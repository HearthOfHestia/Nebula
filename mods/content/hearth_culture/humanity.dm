	Similarly, it is home to a growing number of artists and wanderers, choosing to live in the Hub's residential complex and contributing to it's finances. \
	As a multinational and multicultural project, it has developed its own political system, largely considered technocratic. Highly influential scientists \

	The planet's surface remains as lifeless as it has for millennia, with any terraforming efforts only around fifty years into a centuries long project. Instead, \
	humanity lives under massive biodome structures that keeps the air in and the deadly Martian conditions out. Though these biodomes are fitted to earth atmosphere, \

	of districts and colonies, some loyal to their Earthly benefactor, others dismissive, some owned by corporations, and a lucky few governed by themselves.  \
	To prevent any sort of conflict between the colonies, the Martial Council convene every month, serving as an intranational organisation, similar to an old UN. The \

	bolstered by their pragmatic attitudes, they also have an affinity towards enclosed spaces, a by-product of their time spent underneath the moon's ice sheets within \
	the expansive man-made underwater habitats. Europans are typically average when it comes to general intelligence, however they excel in the fields of agriculture and \
	engineering. Health-wise Europans are healthy for the most part with the exception of often suffering from severe vitamin-D deficiency, \
	leading to them acquiring a sickly pale look."

	description = "You are from one of the first major industrial colonisation efforts of Earth. Over a hundred and fifty years ago, your ancestors bravely set out from \
	the conditions of Earth and into an unknown future. Most colonies across the asteroid belt lasted only a few decades, being mined swiftly into submission, \
	with most resources being shipped away. As such, a massive diasphora has grown across the largest, and oldest of the Belter colonies, Ceres, which has become home \
	to a far reaching local government, extending its influence across almost the entire Belt. Ceres has begun a far reaching project to acquire the former corporate-owned \
	asteroid colonies, with most of them now falling under Belter influence. With the arrival of local government, these asteroid colonies have found themselves with a \

	during gestation. Purpose-grown vatgrowns tend to be somewhat inflexible and bad at thinking outside the box, but this disappears after they gain a considerable amount of 'real' experience.\
	Vatgrown humans are sapient, ergo, they are protected under various sapient rights declarations. Vatgrowns come from a variety of places, from \
	certain companies - with some, but not all, known to use strong 'employee retention' measures on the vatborn employees they grow - to insular cultures made up mostly of vatgrowns who continue to grow new individuals \
	as a means of continuing their way of life. Vatgrowns remain a subject of considerable moral and legal strife, mostly centered around aformentioned corporations and their \
	abhorrent practices. Corporate vatgrowns are typically grown without the innate knowledge of certain skills - like cooking - but are fully capable of learning these concepts."

	called the Republic of the Humble Servants of God. Largely considered strange and eccentric, many considered the mission a suicide effort on a grand scale, but money and power \
	allowed them to set off on their mission. The culture of New Aaron is widely departed from their origins on Earth, having drifted over a hundred and nineteen years. Aaronite culture is \
	very protective of women, but in a highly reversed fashion - something inhibits the birth of women, and nobody is quite sure why. Women generally are held in higher regard than men, and often \
	hold office or other important positions. Marriages are typically polygamous as well - with multiple men and one woman. Despite the cultural drift, Aaronites are known as friendly and \
	hard working folks that like to keep to themselves. New Aaron is a somewhat hostile place, however, with higher than usual radiation and heavy metal content, but it appears that \

	The outposts here are as varied as humanity, though separated by unimaginable distances. Any nation with a presence in space has established at least one outpost \
	here, such as the long-term research stations constructed out here, observing far-away worlds with as little obstruction as possible. Or perhaps you grew up on one of \
	the many makeshift habitats sent out here by anyone with the funds and an idea. Far from any prying eyes, these locations offer their inhabitants the ability to \
	experiment with new societies, ones that could not be tried in the more developed areas of the system. While many may have fallen prey to the rigors of living in space, \
	many more have succeeded, though few know or care. The Cloud has often been regarded as a lawless frontier, the modern Wild West. Among people who grew up here, \
	an experimental spirit can be seen, and the pursuit of novelty held in high regard."

	placed on the production of organic materials and fertilizers, especially around Pluto, to support artificial ecosystems in the outer system and beyond. \
	The Belt had been host to various habitats for the ultra-wealthy, but the population swelled when many from Earth, especially from Africa, established \
	settlements to fill this logistical niche. These endeavors often failed, and left many too destitute to return home, forced to live a life of subsistence. \
	Finding communication with other stations within the Belt difficult, many inhabitants looked inward, and developed a greater connection to their fellow colonists. \
	Even when leaving it all behind, most Brinkers continue to place great amounts of trust and care into those they work alongside."
