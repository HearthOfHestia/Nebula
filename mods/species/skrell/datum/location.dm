	warmer than Qerr'Balak, with hundreds of different cities dotting the surface, most of which are heavily invested in manufacturing and logistics, benefiting from the \

	underground fauna and flora. Despite it's radius being about three times that of Qerr'Balaks, the giant, superhabitable 'karst-world' has an abnormally low gravity and is incapable \
	of holding its atmosphere well, making cave habitation and underground structures the preffered method of habitation of the skrell who \

	Composed mainly of huge, low-technology orbital installations in varying states of disrepair, the Directorate is today one of the most multi-cultural factions in the Galaxy, \
	owing to its population composed mostly of Ue-Katish, and close proximity to humans who often trade with them. Some even inhabit there, although the Skrell of the directorate \
	are *very* different from those in the core territories, who may view them with fascination disgust, or even fear. Regardless, the prospect that a Caste system is perhaps \
